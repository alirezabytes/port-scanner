# Port Scanner with Python
This is a simple Python script for scanning network ports. It allows you to check open ports on a local or custom IP address.

## How to Use
1. Download the `port_scanner.py` file.
2. Install Python 3.x (socket library is included by default).
3. Run the script and choose option 1 (local scan) or 2 (custom scan).
4. For option 2, enter the IP address (e.g., 127.0.0.1) and ports (e.g., 80,443,22).

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- No additional libraries required (socket is built-in).

## Warning
Port scanning on networks you do not have permission to scan is illegal. Use this only on your own system or authorized networks!
